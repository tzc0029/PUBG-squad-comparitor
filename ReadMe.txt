Included in the zip file are the NetBeans project file, 
a video of the application, the SQL script for the database,
a dump of the database used in the video, and this ReadMe file

To operate the application changes to the change1.jsp, change2.jsp,
change3.jsp, change4.jsp, loginprocess.jsp, signupprocess.jsp,
userprofile.jsp, and APIGetServlet.java files may need to be 
made in order to access the database.  The current username is
"root" and the current password is "1q2w3e4r" and these should
reflect the server that the database is hosted on.
